Certain EXCLUDED SOFTWARE may be covered by open source software licenses ("Open Source Components"), which means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including but not limited to any license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format.  Applicable Open Source Components in the SOFTWARE are listed in Exhibit A attached hereto, together with the applicable terms and conditions governing its use. Such terms and conditions may be changed by the applicable third party at any time without liability to you. To the extent required by the licenses covering EXCLUDED SOFTWARE, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this EULA. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to EXCLUDED SOFTWARE prohibit any of the restrictions in this EULA with respect to such EXCLUDED SOFTWARE, such restrictions will not apply to such EXCLUDED SOFTWARE.

USE OF THE CONTENT SERVICE REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION. THE CONTENT SERVICE MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.\n\nINTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND THIRD PARTY SERVICES\nYou acknowledge and agree that access to certain SOFTWARE features may require an Internet connection for which you are solely responsible. Operation of the SOFTWARE may be limited or restricted depending on the capabilities, bandwidth or technical limitations of your Internet connection and service.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THESE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\nSONY AND EACH OF THE THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS (for purposes of this Section, SONY and each of the THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS shall be collectively referred to as "SONY") SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY ASSOCIATED HARDWARE, DOWN TIME AND USER'S TIME, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, EACH AND ALL OF THEIR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ABOVE APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nCONSENT TO USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION, LOCATION DATA, DATA SECURITY\nYou acknowledge and agree that SONY and its affiliates, partners and agents may read, collect, transfer, process and store certain information collected from the SOFTWARE, including but not limited to information about (i) the SOFTWARE and (ii) the software applications, contents and peripheral devices that interact with the DEVICE and the SOFTWARE ("Information").

Such uses include, but are not limited to\: (a) administering the functionalities of the SOFTWARE; (b) to improve, service, update or upgrade the SOFTWARE; (c) improving, developing and enhancing the current and future products and services of SONY and other parties; (d) with your consent, to provide you with information about the products and services offered by SONY and other parties; (e) complying with applicable laws or regulations; and (f) with your consent and to the extent offered, providing you with location-based services of SONY and other parties, as indicated below. In addition, SONY retains the right to use Information to protect itself and third parties from illegal, criminal or harmful conduct.\n\nCertain services available through the SOFTWARE may rely upon location information, including, but not limited to, the geographic location of the DEVICE. You acknowledge that for the purpose of providing such services, SONY, the THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS or their partners may collect, archive, process and use such location data, and that such services are governed by the privacy policies of SONY or such third party. By using any such services, you agree that you have reviewed the privacy policies applicable to such services and consent to such activities.\n\nSONY, its affiliates, partners and agents will not use Information to personally identify the owner or user of the SOFTWARE without your knowledge or consent. Any use of Information will be in accordance with the privacy policies of SONY or such third party.  SONY's current privacy policy can be found on your local country Sony website, such as\:\nhttp\://www.sony.co.jp/privacy/en/index.html\nwww.sony-europe.com.\n\nPlease contact applicable third parties for privacy policies relating to personally identifiable and other information you provide when you use or access third party software or services.\n\nInformation may be processed, stored or transferred to SONY, its affiliates or agents which are located in countries outside of your country of residence. Data protection and information privacy laws in certain countries may not offer the same level of protection as your country of residence and you may have fewer legal rights in relation to Information processed and stored in, or transferred to, such countries. SONY will use reasonable efforts to take appropriate technical and organizational steps to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Information, but does not warrant it will eliminate all risk of misuse of such Information.\n\nAUTOMATIC UPDATE FEATURE\nFrom time to time, SONY or the THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS may automatically update or otherwise modify the SOFTWARE, including, but not limited to, for purposes of enhancement of security functions, error correction and improvement of functions, at such time as you interact with SONY's or third parties' servers, or otherwise. Such updates or modifications may delete or change the nature of features or other aspects of the SOFTWARE, including, but not limited to, functions you may rely upon. You acknowledge and agree that such activities may occur at SONY's sole discretion and that SONY may condition continued use of the SOFTWARE upon your complete installation or acceptance of such update or modifications. Any updates/modifications shall be deemed to be, and shall constitute part of, the SOFTWARE for purposes of this EULA. By acceptance of this EULA, you consent to such update/modification.\n\nENTIRE AGREEMENT, WAIVER, SEVERABILITY\nThis EULA and SONY's privacy policy, each as amended and modified from time to time, together constitute the entire agreement between you and SONY with respect to the SOFTWARE. The failure of SONY to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this EULA shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of this EULA is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to maintain the intent of this EULA, and the other parts will remain in full force and effect.\n\nGOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this EULA. This EULA shall be governed by the laws of the applicable territory where the SOFTWARE is distributed, without regards to conflict of laws provisions. Any dispute arising out of this EULA shall be subject to the exclusive venue of the courts where the SOFTWARE is distributed, and the parties hereby consent to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts.\n\nEQUITABLE REMEDIES\nNotwithstanding anything contained in this EULA to the contrary, you acknowledge and agree that any violation of or non-compliance with this EULA by you will cause irreparable harm to SONY, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to SONY obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that SONY deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. SONY may also take any legal and technical remedies to prevent violation of and/or to enforce this EULA, including, but not limited to, immediate termination of your use of the SOFTWARE, if SONY believes in its sole discretion that you are violating or intend to violate this EULA. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies SONY may have at law, in equity or under contract.\n\nTERMINATION\nWithout prejudice to any of its other rights, SONY may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with any of its terms. In case of such termination, you must\: (i) cease all use, and destroy any copies, of the SOFTWARE; (ii) comply with the requirements in the section below entitled "Your Account Responsibilities".\n\nAMENDMENT\nSONY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION BY POSTING NOTICE ON A SONY DESIGNATED WEB SITE, BY EMAIL NOTIFICATION TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS PROVIDED BY YOU, BY PROVIDING NOTICE AS PART OF THE PROCESS IN WHICH YOU OBTAIN UPGRADES/UPDATES OR BY ANY OTHER LEGALLY RECOGNIZABLE FORM OF NOTICE. If you do not agree to the amendment, you should promptly contact SONY for instructions. Your continued use of the SOFTWARE after the effective date of any such notice shall be deemed your agreement to be bound by such amendment.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES\nEach THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIER is an express intended third-party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, each provision of this EULA with respect to the SOFTWARE of such party.\n\nYOUR ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITIES\nShould you return the DEVICE to its place of purchase, sell or otherwise transfer the Device, or if this EULA is terminated, you are responsible for and must uninstall the SOFTWARE from the DEVICE and delete any and all accounts you may have established on DEVICE or are accessible through the SOFTWARE.
